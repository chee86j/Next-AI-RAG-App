# Step 01 - Engineering Kickoff

## Objective
Establish a shared understanding of the Parsity-aligned roadmap (see `jira_plan.md`) and confirm the engineering guardrails from `.cursor/rules/engineering` before writing any code.

## Why This Matters
- The engineering rules call for 70% planning, 30% execution, so we start by documenting intent.
- A dedicated `/Instructions` workspace keeps PRDs, tech stack notes, and future step logs accessible to everyone.
- Sequentially numbered step files turn the build into a teachable series you can follow or replay later.

## References
- `jira_plan.md` (Epics 1-5 overview)
- `.cursor/rules/engineering/*` (coding principles, design rules, testing guidance)

## Next Actions
1. Draft `PRD.md` capturing user stories, flows, and edge cases.
2. Write `TechStack.md` to document frameworks, libraries, and tooling decisions.
3. Once the instructions pack is ready, move to Step 02 to verify the starter kit and repository configuration.
