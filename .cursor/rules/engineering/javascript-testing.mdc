- Use Vitest or Jest with Testing Library for React components.
- Keep tests deterministic: no reliance on network, real timers, or randomness without seeding.
- Group tests by feature/behavior, not implementation detail.
- Use descriptive `it` statements (“renders loading state while streaming”).
- Prefer factory helpers/fixtures over inline mock data duplication.
- Enforce cleanup between tests to avoid cross-test leakage.
