- Favor composition over inheritance; build small reusable hooks/components.
- Encapsulate side effects (network calls, storage, logging) inside dedicated services.
- Keep presentation, domain logic, and data access separated to ease testing.
- Follow SRP (single responsibility) when designing modules and functions.
- Document non-obvious decisions via block comments referencing Jira stories.
- When adding features, start with the PRD + TechStack context to avoid scope drift.
