- Write TypeScript whenever possible; avoid plain JavaScript modules unless absolutely necessary.
- Use functional React components with hooks; never use legacy class components.
- Prefer named exports; reserve default exports for Next.js pages/layouts.
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines where possible); extract helper utilities into `/src/lib`.
- Import modules via the `@/*` alias configured in `tsconfig.json`.
- Handle async errors with `try/catch`; never ignore Promise rejections.
